Style and architecture notes
----------------------------

* A fair amount of the handler code was written by Amazon so the style might be a bit weird and I'm trying to make it more normal
* I'm trying to follow PEP-8 but not a zealot about line length
* I'm trying to use double-quoted strings over single-quoted when possible (still lots of Amazon code to change)
* Trying to break up the code into smaller files but the sample handler was a megafile
*
